Lesson 1: Setting Up the Project Environment

Step 1: Install Python
Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Make sure that you are using python version 3 or later.

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Option 1: Using venv Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to create a virtual environment named 'venv':
python -m venv venv

Option 2: Using conda
If you're using Anaconda, open Anaconda Prompt and navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to create a virtual environment named 'myenv':
conda create --name myenv

Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
Option 1: Using venv
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Option 2: Using conda
Activate the environment using the following command:
conda activate myenv

Step 4: Install Dependencies
Use pip to install necessary dependencies.
For example, to install pytest, run the following command:
pip install pytest

Step 6: Test Setup
Ensure everything is set up correctly by running the simple 'Hello World' program that is in main.py using
the following command.
python main.py
